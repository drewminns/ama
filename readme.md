Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

My name is Drew Minns! I'm a Lead Developer and Instructor with [HackerYou](http://hackeryou.com) in Toronto, Canada. 
I'm passionate about tech education, semantics and punk. I create rad things at [drewminns.com](http://drewminns.com) and write at [medium.com/@drewisthe](https://medium.com/@drewisthe), [Six Revisions](http://sixrevisions) and soon, [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/).

Currently interested in React, PostCSS and ES2015.
